> Metadata is a word that means “data about data”. Probably the best way to think of it is when you’re looking at a physical book. A book is filled with quite a bit of data: the tens of thousands of words that fill its pages. If the only way we could tell two books apart was to read the two books, it would be hard to find the book that we want.

> Instead, books have information on them. The spine of a book almost always includes the title and author, which lets us find the book we want. The library by me goes one step further for the genre fiction sections, giving books stickers so one can tell science fiction, fantasy, and mystery novels apart. 

> 元数据是一个表示“关于数据的数据”的词。最好的理解方式可能是当你在看一本实体书的时候。这本书里面充满了大量的数据：填满其页面的成千上万的单词。如果我们区分两本书的唯一方式是阅读这两本书，那将很难找到我们想要的书。

> 相反，书籍上有信息。书的脊背几乎总是包括标题和作者，这使我们能够找到我们想要的书。我附近的图书馆在类型小说的部分更进一步，为书籍贴上标签，以便人们能够区分科幻小说、奇幻小说和神秘小说。
